This is bascially about the change in this file but not in the main github file.


In the Git there is a four state of a file or something...
First one is Untracked which means in this the new file is generated but not commit or add in the main file or repo of gitHub.
Second one is Modified which means the file which is already in the GitHub repo but do some small changes in the file but not add and commit to the main repo.
Third one is Staged which means the modified file or newfile is ready to get commit in the main repo of the GitHub 
Fourth one is Unchanged which means the file is changed and successfully add and commit all the changes to the main repo of the GitHub.

Now we talk about the Add and Commit command.
Add - In this we are easily add the file or ready the file to get staged to the main repo of the GitHub.
syntax for add file - git.add <.filename.>

Commit - In this we are going to commit the message in the main repo of the GitHub
synatx for commit the file - git.commit -m "Some meaningful message"
